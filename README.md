Hello, my name is Elvia Andriyani. I am a student at Universitas PGRI Semarang majoring in Informatics Engineering. Currently, I am taking the MSIB LearningX program which helps me develop skills in technology and business. I have an interest in technology development, especially those that support the creative and digital economy.

I have basic programming skills such as Python and a little experience with data management. In addition, I am also interested in entrepreneurship, especially in the skincare sector and developing family businesses in the palm oil plantation sector.
